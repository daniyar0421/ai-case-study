## Recommendations 
#### *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?*

As the visionary behind SORA AI, I am deeply committed to OpenAI's mission of developing safe and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that will shape humanity's future for the better. With this in mind, I have devised a groundbreaking strategy to leverage ChatGPT's capabilities in order to revolutionize how we approach self-improvement and ethics education, particularly for children.

My plan is to compile a curated list of the most impactful books on self-improvement and ethics, using ChatGPT to assist in this process. These resources will serve as the cornerstone for creating engaging and easy-to-understand content tailored specifically for kids. My aim is to distill the essence of these books into simple, yet compelling prompts that form the basis of captivating storylines.

Drawing inspiration from the beloved Marvel universe, I envision creating a vibrant brand that captures the imagination of children worldwide. Through this brand, we will introduce a diverse cast of heroes and narratives, each designed to impart important values and principles in a fun and relatable way.

While I personally enjoy reading, I recognize that not everyone shares this passion. Therefore, my strategy is to eliminate the need for extensive reading by delivering complex concepts in a simple and engaging format. By doing so, we not only make valuable knowledge accessible to all, but also spark curiosity and foster a love for learning.

Additionally, I am deeply committed to ensuring that our initiative reaches those who need it most. By focusing on third-world countries with limited access to education and information, we can make a meaningful impact on communities that are often overlooked.

In summary, my vision for SORA AI is to empower individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and circumstances with the tools they need to thrive in an increasingly complex world. By combining the power of technology with the magic of storytelling, we can inspire positive change and create a brighter future for generations to come.
